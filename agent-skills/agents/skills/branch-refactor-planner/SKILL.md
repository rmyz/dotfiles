description: Critically review all code changes on the current branch against the base branch, identify improvement opportunities across naming, structure, DRY/KISS/YAGNI, declarative style, self-documenting code, edge cases, testing, and general best practices, then produce a categorized refactoring plan with prioritized action items. Use when the user asks to review, clean up, or refactor branch changes, or mentions "refactor plan", "code quality review", or "clean up this branch".

# Branch Refactor Planner

Systematically review every file changed on the current branch, apply the
quality checklist below, and produce a prioritized refactoring plan.

## Investigation workflow

1. **Determine base branch**
   - `git merge-base HEAD main` (fall back to `master` or the branch the user specifies).
2. **Gather the changeset**
   - `git diff --name-only <base>...HEAD` for the file list.
   - `git diff <base>...HEAD` for the full diff.
3. **Read changed files in full** -- not just diff hunks. Surrounding context
   reveals duplication, naming drift, and missing edge-case handling that hunks alone hide.
4. **Cross-reference related files** -- look for shared patterns, duplicated
   logic across the changeset, and opportunities to extract helpers or reuse
   existing project utilities.
5. **Consult project rules** -- if the repo contains `AGENTS.md`,
   `.cursor/rules/`, or equivalent conventions, incorporate them into the review.
6. **Produce the plan** using the output format below.

## Quality dimensions

Walk through every dimension for each changed file:

| Dimension | What to look for |
|---|---|
| **Naming** | Variables, functions, types, and files convey intent and follow project conventions |
| **Helper utils** | Hand-rolled logic replaceable by standard library, lodash, or project-shared code |
| **Declarative style** | Imperative loops/mutation replaceable by map/filter/reduce, config objects, or declarative patterns |
| **Self-documenting code** | Code reads clearly without comments; flag redundant comments and missing non-obvious ones |
| **Edge cases** | Null/undefined, empty collections, boundary values, error paths |
| **Testing** | Tests are meaningful and non-redundant; flag no-op assertions, duplicate coverage, and missing coverage |
| **DRY** | Duplicated logic across or within files |
| **KISS** | Over-engineered abstractions, unnecessary indirection |
| **YAGNI** | Code, config, or types added speculatively without current need |
| **Control flow** | Early returns, positive conditions, flat nesting |
| **Type safety** | `any`/`unknown` usage, non-null assertions, missing return types |
| **Error handling** | Explicit and typed; no swallowed errors |
| **Consistency** | Patterns within the changeset are internally consistent |

## Summary
<1-2 sentences on overall quality and recurring themes>

## Action items

### Critical (correctness / bugs)
- [ ] `file:line` [dimension] -- concrete suggestion

### High (maintainability / readability)
- [ ] `file:line` [dimension] -- concrete suggestion

### Low (style / polish)
- [ ] `file:line` [dimension] -- concrete suggestion

## Files reviewed
- `path/to/file.ts` -- one-line verdict
```

Rules for action items:
- Cite file path and line range.
- Tag with the quality dimension in brackets.
- Give a concrete suggestion, not a vague observation
  (e.g. "rename `proc` to `processDocument`", not "improve naming").
- If a test should be removed or rewritten, explain why it provides no value.
