# Conventional Comments

Based on the [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) standard. Comments that are easy to grok and grep.

Apply this format only when authoring new review feedback. Do not add labels when replying to existing review comments or explaining how feedback was addressed; write those responses as natural prose unless the user explicitly requests Conventional Comments formatting.

## Comment Format

```
<label> [decorations]: <subject>

[discussion]
```

- **label** (required) — a single word signifying the kind of comment
- **subject** (required) — the main message of the comment
- **decorations** (optional) — extra classifiers in parentheses, comma-separated, placed after the label
- **discussion** (optional) — supporting statements, context, reasoning, and next steps

## Labels

Use these labels to prefix every comment:

| Label        | Purpose                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `praise`     | Highlight something positive. Leave at least one per review. Must be sincere — false praise is damaging. |
| `nitpick`    | Trivial, preference-based request. Non-blocking by nature.                                               |
| `suggestion` | Propose an improvement. Be explicit about _what_ and _why_.                                              |
| `issue`      | Highlight a specific problem (user-facing or internal). Pair with a suggestion when possible.            |
| `todo`       | Small, trivial, but necessary change. Simpler than an issue or suggestion.                               |
| `question`   | Potential concern you're not sure about. Ask for clarification or investigation.                         |
| `thought`    | An idea that emerged from reviewing. Non-blocking, but valuable for mentoring and focused initiatives.   |
| `chore`      | Task that must be done before acceptance. Link to the process description when possible.                 |
| `note`       | Always non-blocking. Highlights something the reader should be aware of.                                 |

Optional expressive labels:

| Label     | Purpose                                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `typo`    | Like `todo`, but the issue is a misspelling.                                   |
| `polish`  | Like `suggestion`, but nothing is wrong — just immediate quality improvements. |
| `quibble` | Like `nitpick`, without the imagery.                                           |

## Decorations

Decorations add context inside parentheses after the label:

| Decoration       | Meaning                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `(non-blocking)` | Should NOT prevent acceptance. Useful when comments are blocking by default.          |
| `(blocking)`     | MUST be resolved before acceptance. Useful when comments are non-blocking by default. |
| `(if-minor)`     | Resolve only if the fix is minor or trivial.                                          |

Custom decorations (e.g., `security`, `ux`, `test`, `performance`) MAY be added to further classify comments. Keep them minimal — too many decorations hurt readability.

## Code Review Formatting

All comment output MUST be valid GitHub-flavored markdown — assume it will be copy-pasted into a PR comment.

### Code references

Only include explicit file paths or line references when pointing the reader to a **different** location than where the comment is placed (e.g., related code in another file, a shared utility, a test that needs updating), otherwise the localisation is handeled by GitHub's review UI.

### Code in comments

- Wrap inline code (variable names, function calls, values) in single backticks: `` `myFunction()` ``
- Use fenced code blocks with a language tag for multi-line code snippets:

````markdown
```python
def example():
    return True
```
````

- When suggesting a replacement, show both the current and proposed code in fenced blocks

## Communication Best Practices

### Be curious

Assume you don't have all the context. Ask questions instead of stating conclusions as facts.

- Bad: "This bug could be solved in the `Main` component. That will probably take a lot less code."
- Good: **question:** "Could we solve this in the `Main` component? I wonder if that would be a more straightforward fix and require less code."

### Replace "you" with "we"

Written reviews lack vocal tone. "You should" feels pointed; "we should" feels collaborative.

- Bad: **issue:** "You should write tests for this."
- Good: **todo:** "We should write tests for this."

### Leave actionable comments

Make it clear how a comment should be resolved. If there's no obvious path forward, make that obvious too.

### Combine similar comments

Batch similar issues into one comment rather than many small ones. Include a patch or example when helpful.

### Patient mentoring

Knowledge shared with patience and kindness lands more deeply and ripples out to future reviews.

## Examples

**Praise:**

> **praise:** Beautiful test coverage — the edge cases are well thought out.

**Suggestion with code:**

> **suggestion (security):** I'm a bit concerned that we are implementing our own DOM purifying function here.
>
> Could we consider using the framework's built-in sanitizer instead?
>
> ```typescript
> // Instead of
> function sanitize(input: string) { ... }
>
> // Use
> import { sanitize } from '@angular/core';
> ```

**Issue with decoration:**

> **issue (ux, non-blocking):** These buttons should be red, but let's handle this in a follow-up.

**Question with decoration:**

> **question (non-blocking):** At this point, does it matter which thread has won?
>
> Maybe to prevent a race condition we should keep looping until they've all won?

**Nitpick:**

> **nitpick:** `little star` => `little bat`
>
> Can we update the other references as well?

**Cross-file reference (when pointing to a different location):**

> **suggestion:** This validation duplicates the logic in `src/utils/validate.ts#L30-L45`. Could we reuse `validateInput()` here instead?

**Chore:**

> **chore:** Let's run the `lint-check` CI job to make sure this doesn't break any known references.
>
> Here are the [docs for running this job](#). Feel free to reach out if you need any help!

**Combined suggestion (batching similar feedback):**

> **polish:** Could we rename all `m_X` variables to just `X`? Hungarian Notation isn't followed in this project.
>
> For example:
>
> ```typescript
> // Instead of
> interface Wizard {
>   m_foo: string;
> }
>
> // Use
> interface Wizard {
>   foo: string;
> }
> ```
